//Spiderman is stuck in a difficult situation. His arch-enemy the Green Goblin has planted several of his infamous Pumpkin Bombs in various locations in a building. Help Spiderman activate his Spidey Sense and identify the impact zones. 
//He has a blueprint of the building which is a M x N matrix that is filled with the characters ‘O’, ‘B’, and ‘W’ where: 
//‘O’ represents an open space.
//‘B’ represents a bomb.
//‘W’ represents a wall.
//You have to replace all of the O’s (open spaces) in the matrix with their shortest distance from a bomb without being able to go through any walls. Also, replace the bombs with 0 and walls with -1 in the resultant matrix. If no path exists between a bomb and an open space replace the corresponding 'O' with -1.

//Example :

//Input: N = 3, M = 3
//A[] = {{O, O, O}, 
//       {W, B, B}, 
//       {W, O, O}}
//Output: {{2, 1, 1}, 
//         {-1, 0, 0},  
//         {-1, 1, 1}}
//Explanation: The walls at (1,0) and (2,0) 
//are replaced by -1. The bombs at (1,1) and 
//(1,2) are replaced by 0. The impact zone 
//for the bomb at (1,1) includes open spaces at index (0,0), (0,1) and (2,1) with distance 
//from bomb calculated as 2,1,1 respectively. The impact zone for the bomb at (1,2) includes open spaces at index (0,3) and (2,2) with distance from bomb calculated as 1,1 respectively.
